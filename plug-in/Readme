Russell Conjugative Debiased Reading

The project build and deploy a prototype bias-revealing browser plug-in, which reveal hidden sources of emotive bias in news stories.
In this project we have created a plug-in using JavaScript so that when we click on it, we will pick up the whole text of our news website.
We pass this information to our server to process the information. 

The server uses python. The information is process and will be return to our plug-in with with the adjectives highlighted and a drop-down window
to see the russell synonyms. 

Previously we have created a word dictionary using 17.000 new web pages that collected ourselves. In this dictionary, we have each word and 
polarity sentiment level. The polarity is normalize between +1 (maximum positive level) and -1 (maximum negative level). 
To create this dictionary we have analysed each of the phrases of the 17,000 web pages. And created a dictionary of polarity depending on 
certain aspects that are given in each sentence like: negation, question marks, capital letters or the position in the sentence.

To be able to use the program you must have the server running in some computer interface and the plug-in must be in a Chrome browser.
