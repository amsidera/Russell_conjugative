# Russell conjugative debiased reading

In rhetoric, emotive or emotional conjugation mimics the form of a grammatical conjugation of an irregular verb to illustrate humans' tendency to describe their own
behavior more charitably than the behavior of others. The use of subtly emotive language can bias interpretation of otherwise objective and accurate characterizations
of people and events. Speechwriters and rhetoricians have used careful word choice to good effect. 
In this research project, I built and deployed a prototype bias-revealing browser plugin. This web extension reveal hidden sources of emotive bias in news stories and web pages. The main goal of this project is to investigate to the extent to which
Russell conjugations are used to bias rhetoric, to develop tools to make readers aware of such rhetorical tricks, and to investigate how such tools affect readers perceptions of bias and evaluation of information.

In this project we have developed a plug-in for Chrome in JavaScript and a background in Python (NLTK, BeautifulSoup and Flask) to perform the process of analysis of synonyms and adaptation of
the new page in HTML and CSS. Before being able to use it, we had to analyze 17,000 news web pages to make an extensive vocabulary with words to know its polarity.
